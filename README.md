# personal-autonomous-parking-car-raspberry
A simple electric car model was build using Raspbery pi. The car has remote control and autonomous operation capabilities. 


# Features
It main features are:
- Remote, teleoperated, driving capability
- Fully autonomous parking capability
- Omni-directional moving capability

This simply project is meant to illustrate how an autonomous parking assistance feature could be integrated into an omni-directional electric car.

# Operation
The expected operational process would be as follows:

1) Under normal driving status the driver operates the electric car through a remote control
2) When the driver decides that he/she wishes to park somewhere, he/she initiates the parking assistance procedure
3) The parking assistance module searches the near vicinity of the car with its ultrasonic sensor for an appropriate parking spot where the car could fit
4) If the spot is identified the car makes the required manoeuvres and performs the parking operation autonomously.
5) If no appropriate parking spot is identified the car notifies the driver to resume driving
